Reading is a happy thing. For those who love reading, once they read it,
they can't stop, they can't give up reading, they want to read to the
ends of the world. Some people say: "the deepest and most peaceful
happiness Calm down, open the book, the deposition
of ink a little bit over the space, those dusty happiness a little bit
open. Reading is really fun.
